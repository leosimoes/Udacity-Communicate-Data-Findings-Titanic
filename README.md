# Titanic: Data Analysis with Visualizations

Project 5 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.


## Dataset

The data set is the one suggested at the end of the Intro to Data Analysis course, but it also satisfies the conditions imposed on the respective task of the Nanodegree program Data Analyst.
Thisdata set is for Titanic passengers, and was made available by Kaggle. 
The data analysis is focused on the characteristics of the Titanic's passengers.

## Summary of Findings

- Of the 891 passengers, 549 (61.62%) did not survive and 342 (38.38%) survived.
- Class 3 has 491 passengers, more than the other two combined, being class 1 with 216 and class 2 with 184 passengers.
- There are more male passengers, 577 (about 65%), than women, which are 314 (about 35%).
- The oldest passenger was 80 years old. The average age of passengers is approximately 29 years.
- The average fare value is 32.20 dollars and the most expensive was 512.32 dollars. The lowest price paid for a ticket (excluding free tickets) was 4.01 dollars.
- Most survivors are in the 15 to 40 age range. For females, children under 15 survived much longer than males of the same age.
- Fare value ranges vary considerably depending on where the shipment was made. Most of those who boarded Cherbourg paid much more than elsewhere. Queenstown people paid much less. The few passengers who paid much more than the others boarded Southampton or Cherbourg.
- There does not seem to be a trend between the combined Fare, Age and Embarked features.
- In all classes, women on average would be younger than men.
- On average, survivors, both men and women, paid much more than non-survivors.
- The average age of men and women for survivors and non-survivors varies up to just 5 years. Older women seem to have survived longer than younger women. With the men, it was the opposite, the younger ones seem to have survived longer than the older ones.


## Key Insights for Presentation

A main objective of the exploratory analysis was to observe the characteristics of passengers, their differences and trends.
Despite the greater number of men in all classes and in total, the number of women who survived was far greater than theirs. Some anomalies were observed, such as the prices of some tickets being much higher than others of the same class.
